# What We Set Up For You

## Consistent Data

Some data is consistent across freight forwarders. Everyone works with Countries, Cities, Incoterms etc. 

When you get access to the system, the following should be set up for you already.

* [ ] Countries
* [ ] Cities
* [ ] World-wide Ports
* [ ] Incoterms
* [ ] Mode Groups
* [ ] Australian Suburbs
* [ ] Container Types

{% hint style="info" %}
Your system administrators can still change the data.
{% endhint %}

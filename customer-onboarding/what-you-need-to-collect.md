# What You Need to Collect

## Custom Data

For your system to function properly, you'll need to collect the details for the following data sets.

You will of course need details of what information to collect. You'll find these details at the end of this section. For now, here's the list you'll need to work through.

#### Your Service Providers and their Rates

* [ ] Agents
* [ ] Wholesalers
* [ ] Freight Carriers
* [ ] Airline Carriers
* [ ] Cartage Providers
* [ ] Courier Zones
* [ ] Rates for the above service providers
* [ ] Origin Regions that influence your Port Charges
* [ ] Port Charges
* [ ] Air Terminal Charges

#### Your Company

* [ ] Users
* [ ] User Roles
* [ ] Company Departments
* [ ] Staff
* [ ] Currencies

{% hint style="info" %}
Users are different from Staff, because not all your staff members will access the system, though they may still be involved in your process.  
  
At the very least, we need details of one Administrator user who can set up your other users.
{% endhint %}

#### Your Customers

* [ ] Customer Classes
* [ ] Customers
* [ ] Customer Contacts
* [ ] Standard Charges specific to Customers
* [ ] Standard Charges applicable to Customer Class

#### Your Software Licenses

NavLab uses the Google Maps Application Programming Interface to calculate distances from ports to suburbs. This allows you to quote a distance-based cartage fee. Your company will need to set up a Google Account with Billing information and provide us with the login details to configure your system correctly.

## Data Set Fields

Below you can find export files for all of the above data sets. Try to collect as much information as possible, starting from left to right, because some fields are required.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/staff-migration-01-12-2020.csv" caption="Zip File Containing All CSV Import Files" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You may choose to enter data directly into the system, but most users prefer to use the import-ready CSV files.
{% endhint %}
